<li><strong>Prepare the puri:</strong> In a large bowl, mix 2 cups of atta flour (whole wheat flour), 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 cup of water to form a dough. Knead the dough for a few minutes until smooth and let it rest for 30 minutes. Roll the dough into small balls and deep fry until puffed and golden brown.</li>
